## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is PM strong enough for high-load applications?
Yes. PM parts can achieve strength comparable to cast iron or forged steel through alloy adjustment, increased density, or secondary forging.

### PM vs CNC: Which is more cost-effective?
For mass production (5,000+ units), PM is significantly cheaper due to near-net shape manufacturing and minimal material waste.

### What materials can PM process?
Almost all metals: iron alloys, stainless steel, copper, aluminum, brass, tungsten, molybdenum, and specialty alloys.

### Why is PM considered "green" technology?
PM achieves 95%+ material utilization with minimal scrap. Sintering below melting point uses less energy than casting.
